# QuantumForensix

QuantumForensix is an advanced digital forensics tool designed for creating and analyzing disk images. It provides a comprehensive set of features for digital investigators and cybersecurity professionals.

## Features

- **Multi-format Disk Imaging**: Create and analyze both raw and E01 (Expert Witness Format) disk images.
- **File System Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis of various file systems using the pytsk3 library.
- **File Type Detection**: Accurately detect file types based on content using the python-magic library.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extract detailed metadata from files, including creation, modification, and access times.
- **File Carving**: Recover deleted files using signature-based file carving techniques.
- **Timeline Analysis**: Generate a comprehensive timeline of file system activities.
- **Hashing**: Calculate and verify file/disk hashes for integrity checks.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for audit trails and debugging purposes.

## Installation

```bash
# TODO: Add installation instructions
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use QuantumForensix:

```python
forensix = QuantumForensix()
forensix.create_disk_image('/path/to/source/device', 'disk_image.E01', format='E01')
forensix.load_image('disk_image.E01')
forensix.analyze_file_system()
print(f"Image hash: {forensix.calculate_hash()}")
metadata = forensix.extract_metadata('/path/to/file/of/interest')
print(f"File metadata: {metadata}")
carved_files = forensix.file_carving(b'\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0')  # JPEG file signature
print(f"QuantumForensix carved {len(carved_files)} potential JPEG files")
timeline = forensix.timeline_analysis()
print("QuantumForensix timeline analysis complete")
```

## Roadmap

### Version 1.1 (Next Release)
- [ ] Implement a command-line interface (CLI) for easier interaction
- [ ] Add support for AFF4 image format
- [ ] Enhance file carving with support for more file types
- [ ] Implement basic reporting functionality

### Version 1.2
- [ ] Develop a graphical user interface (GUI)
- [ ] Add support for network forensics (e.g., PCAP analysis)
- [ ] Implement data deduplication for efficient storage of forensic images
- [ ] Integrate basic machine learning for automated artifact detection

### Version 2.0
- [ ] Implement distributed processing for large-scale forensics
- [ ] Add support for cloud forensics (e.g., analyzing cloud storage artifacts)
- [ ] Develop a plugin system for extensibility
- [ ] Implement advanced data visualization for complex investigations
