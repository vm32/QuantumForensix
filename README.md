## Operating System Compatibility

QuantumForensix is designed to work across multiple platforms. The following table outlines the compatibility of different components with various operating systems:

| Operating System | Core QuantumForensix (Python) | iOSynthesis Module (C) | Target Analysis |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Windows          | ‚úÖ                            | ‚ö†Ô∏è                     | ‚úÖ               |
| macOS            | ‚úÖ                            | ‚úÖ                     | ‚úÖ               |
| Linux            | ‚úÖ                            | ‚úÖ                     | ‚úÖ               |
| iOS              | ‚ùå                            | ‚ùå                     | ‚úÖ               |
| Android          | ‚ùå                            | ‚ùå                     | üöß               |

Legend:
- ‚úÖ Fully supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial support (may require additional setup)
- ‚ùå Not supported yet
- üöß Planned for future release

Notes:
1. The core QuantumForensix tool, written in Python, is cross-platform and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. The iOSynthesis module, written in C, is primarily designed for macOS and Linux. Windows support is partial and may require additional setup (e.g., using WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux).
3. Target Analysis refers to the ability to analyze data from these operating systems, not run on them.
4. iOS devices can be analyzed using the iOSynthesis module when connected to a supported host operating system.
5. Android analysis is planned for a future release.

Please ensure you have the necessary permissions and legal authority before analyzing any device or data.

## Installation

### Core QuantumForensix
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vm32/quantumforensix.git
cd quantumforensix

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### iOSynthesis (iOS Forensics Module)
```bash
# Navigate to the iOSynthesis directory
cd iOSynthesis

# Compile the module
gcc -o iOSynthesis iOSynthesis.c -limobiledevice -lplist -lcrypto -lsqlite3
```

Note: You may need to install additional system libraries depending on your OS. Please refer to the documentation of libimobiledevice, OpenSSL, and SQLite for specific instructions.

## Usage

### Core QuantumForensix
Here's a basic example of how to use the main QuantumForensix toolkit:

```python
from quantumforensix import QuantumForensix

forensix = QuantumForensix()
forensix.create_disk_image('/path/to/source/device', 'disk_image.E01', format='E01')
forensix.load_image('disk_image.E01')
forensix.analyze_file_system()
print(f"Image hash: {forensix.calculate_hash()}")
metadata = forensix.extract_metadata('/path/to/file/of/interest')
print(f"File metadata: {metadata}")
carved_files = forensix.file_carving(b'\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0')  # JPEG file signature
print(f"QuantumForensix carved {len(carved_files)} potential JPEG files")
timeline = forensix.timeline_analysis()
print("QuantumForensix timeline analysis complete")
```

### iOSynthesis (iOS Forensics Module)
To use the iOS forensics module:

```bash
# Ensure an iOS device is connected
./iOSynthesis
```

The tool will automatically:
1. Connect to the attached iOS device
2. Extract and encrypt SMS messages
3. Generate a list of installed applications
4. Create a basic forensic report

Output files:
- `sms_messages.csv.enc`: Encrypted file containing extracted SMS messages
- `installed_apps.csv`: List of installed applications
- `forensic_report.txt`: Basic report summarizing the extraction process

## Security Considerations

- The iOSynthesis module encrypts sensitive data (like SMS messages) using AES-256-CBC.
- Ensure proper key management in a production environment.
- Always obtain necessary permissions before analyzing any device or data.

## Roadmap

### Version 1.1 (Next Release)
- [ ] Implement a command-line interface (CLI) for easier interaction
- [ ] Add support for AFF4 image format
- [ ] Enhance file carving with support for more file types
